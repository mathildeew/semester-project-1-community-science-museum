        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
        <p>A slice of heaven. O for awesome, this chocka full cuzzie is as rip-off as a cracker. Meanwhile, in behind the bicycle shed, Hercules Morse, as big as a horse and Mrs Falani were up to no good with a bunch of crook pikelets.</p>
        <p>A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don’t know who you’re talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I AM the danger!</p>
